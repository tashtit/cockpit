# Contributing to Cockpit

## Prerequisites

- **macOS** — the primary target (the app indexes `~/.claude`, `~/.codex`, `~/.copilot` and is dark-mode-only). Linux works for development and CI.
- **Node 22** — pinned in [`.nvmrc`](.nvmrc); run `nvm use` (or your version manager's equivalent) before installing.
- **npm** — the repo ships a `package-lock.json`; install with `npm ci` to match CI exactly.
- **git**, and the **GitHub CLI (`gh`)** if you want the PR features to work at runtime (not needed to build or test).
- Optional: the `claude` / `codex` / `copilot` CLIs. Without them the app runs with an empty session index; tests don't need them — they run against fixtures written to a tmpdir.

## Setup

```bash
nvm use
npm ci
npm run dev
```

`npm ci` installs only Electron's JS stub — the actual Electron binary (~200 MB) downloads automatically the **first time you run `npm run dev`** ("Downloading Electron binary...") and is cached in `~/Library/Caches/electron`, so it only happens once per Electron version.

### "Electron failed to install correctly"

This message means that first-run binary download failed. Run the downloader directly to see the underlying error:

```bash
npx install-electron
```

Common causes:

- **Proxy or firewall** blocking the fetch from GitHub releases — set `ELECTRON_MIRROR` to a mirror you can reach, then re-run `npx install-electron`.
- **Corrupt cached download** — `rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/electron` and retry.

## Development workflow

| Command | What |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Electron app with HMR |
| `npm run typecheck` | `tsc --noEmit` — the static gate (there is no linter) |
| `npm test` | vitest: unit + component tiers |
| `npm run test:e2e` | Playwright against the built app — run `npm run build` first |

`npm run typecheck` and `npm test` must both pass before a PR; CI ([`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml)) runs typecheck plus all three test tiers.

## Conventions

- **Conventional Commits** (`feat(indexer): …`, `fix(parser): …`, `docs: …`), matching existing history.
- **UI work**: read `design-system/cockpit/MASTER.md` first. Components use the design tokens from the `:root` block of `src/renderer/src/style.css` — never raw hex. Dark mode only.
- Session log parsers must stay failure-tolerant and bounded (≤256 KB per file read) — provider formats drift between releases; skip what you can't read rather than fail the scan.
